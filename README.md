# AUTOMOTIVE ECU COMMUNICATION USING CAN PROTOCOL
A real-time vehicle lighting control system demonstrating Controller Area Network (CAN) communication between two LPC2129 ARM7 microcontrollers. This project implements interrupt-driven message passing for controlling headlights and turn indicators.


# Overview

This project demonstrates automotive Electronic Control Unit (ECU) communication using the CAN protocol. Two nodes communicate over a CAN bus:

Node A (Master/Transmitter): Sends control commands via button presses (external interrupts)
Node B (Slave/Receiver): Receives commands and controls LED outputs (headlight & indicators)


# Problem Statement

Traditional vehicle wiring systems are complex and prone to faults. This project demonstrates how CAN protocol:

Reduces wiring complexity
Provides reliable, real-time communication
Enables modular, scalable automotive networks
Implements fault-tolerant messaging


# Hardware Requirements
Component                                    Description                              Quantity
LPC2129 Microcontroller(Vector Board)       ARM7TDMI-S with built-in CAN controller    2

Push Buttons                                For triggering external interrupts (EINT0, EINT1, EINT2)3

LEDs                                        Representing headlight and indicators      3

Jumper Wires                                For CAN bus connection (CAN_H, CAN_L, GND)

Power Supply                                5V regulated supply for both boards         1


‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Built-in CAN Transceiver
Unlike typical CAN projects, this implementation uses the LPC2129 vector board's integrated CAN transceiver circuitry. Therefore:

No external MCP2551/TJA1050 transceiver needed
CAN_H and CAN_L are directly available on board pins
Simplified hardware setup
Refer to your vector board's schematic for exact CAN pin locations


# Software Requirements

Keil ¬µVision IDE (v5 or later) - For compilation and debugging
Flash Magic - For programming LPC2129 via UART
Proteus Design Suite (optional) - For simulation
Git - For version control
